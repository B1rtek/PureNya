# PureNya~
Esoteric language based on Nya~

PureNya~ only accepts expressions containing full "nya\~"s, which means that every expression must contain at least one 'n', at least one 'y', at least one 'a', and any positive number of '\~' at the end, and these characters must occur in the same order as they do in the word "nya\~".

The original interpreter can be found [here](https://github.com/sech1p/nya)
